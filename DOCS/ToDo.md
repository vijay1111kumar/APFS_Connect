 **To-Do** 
---

### ** Core Components & Registries**
#### **1. Core Block**
- **Flow Loader**:
  - [ ] Define the structure of the Flow Dataset (e.g., JSON schema for flows).
  - [ ] Implement the `Flow Loader` to load flows into the Global Registry.
  - [ ] Add validation rules (e.g., unique flow IDs, valid triggers).
- **Webhook**:
  - [ ] Implement the webhook to handle incoming requests.
  - [ ] Map incoming triggers to flows and pass them to the Processor Block.
- **Processor Block**:
  - [ ] Implement processor execution logic.
  - [ ] Connect the Processor Block to the Global Registry for processor retrieval.

#### **2. Registries**
- **Global Registry**:
  - [ ] Define the structure for storing flows, triggers, and processors.
  - [ ] Implement backup and restore functionality for reliability.
- **Temp Registry**:
  - [ ] Implement a structure to store temporary conversation states.
  - [ ] Add expiration and cleanup logic for efficient resource management.

### ** Supporting Systems**
#### **3. Batch Processor**
- **Uploader**:
  - [ ] Implement functionality to upload datasets into the system.
  - [ ] Define upload validation rules for the Flow and API datasets.
- **Promotion Module**:
  - [ ] Design the structure for managing promotional campaigns.
  - [ ] Integrate the promotion logic with the Core Block.
- **Publisher Module**:
  - [ ] Implement data publishing logic (e.g., to external APIs or systems).
- **Notifier Module**:
  - [ ] Set up a mechanism to send notifications to customers or systems.

#### **4. Data Handling**
- **Data Store**:
  - [ ] Choose a database or file-based storage for persistent data.
  - [ ] Define schemas for logs, flow metadata, and analytics.
- **Logs**:
  - [ ] Enhance the logging system with additional metadata (e.g., request IDs).
  - [ ] Implement log rotation and backup for scalability.

---

### ** Analytics & External Communication**
#### **5. Analytics Module**
- **Logger**:
  - [ ] Implement centralized logging to capture system-wide events.
- **Reporter Module**:
  - [ ] Define reporting templates (e.g., success rates, error analysis).
  - [ ] Implement report generation logic.
- **Dashboard Module**:
  - [ ] Create a basic visual dashboard to display system metrics.

#### **6. External Communication**
- **API Integration**:
  - [ ] Define the API Dataset structure (e.g., JSON schema for API metadata).
  - [ ] Implement the API Module to interact with external systems (Titan, LMS, XYZ).
  - [ ] Add schema validation for API inputs and outputs.

---

### **Cross-Cutting Tasks**
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for all components.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Document the architecture, APIs, and key functions.
- [ ] **Testing**: Write unit tests for the Core Block, Batch Processor, and other modules.
